Welcome to the open-source implementation of
[SCION](http://www.scion-architecture.net) (Scalability, Control and Isolation
On next-generation Networks), a future Internet architecture. SCION is the first
clean-slate Internet architecture designed to provide route control, failure
isolation, and explicit trust information for end-to-end communication. To find
out more about the project, please visit our [documentation
site](https://anapaya-scion.readthedocs-hosted.com/en/latest/).

## SCIONLab / this fork

Join [SCIONLab](https://www.scionlab.org) if you're interested in playing with
SCION in an operational global test deployment of SCION.

This fork of [scionproto/scion](github.com/scionproto/scion), specifically the
branch `scionlab`, is the version of SCION running in
[SCIONLab](https://www.scionlab.org).
Our version moves in a roughly biannual release cycle behind the upstream
master, which is an attempt to find a balance between the cutting edge and
periods of protocol and API stability.
We typically maintain a few SCIONLab specific quirks here. Occasionally, we
include an experimental feature before it becomes available upstream.

## Building / Contributing

project, we support [pre-built binaries as Debian
packages](https://docs.scionlab.org/content/install/).
